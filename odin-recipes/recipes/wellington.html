<h1>Description</h1>
<body>
    <p>A whole beef tenderloin coated and/or wrapped in layers of mustard, mushroom duxelle, prosciutto, and flaky puff pastry</p>
    <p>Though quite an advanced recipe, a successful attempt is well worth the effort</p>

</body>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Beef Tenderloin</li>
    <li>English or German mustard</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>Prosciutto</li>
    <li>Puff Pastry</li>
    <li>Oil/Butter</li>
    <li>Red Wine of choice</li>
    <li>One egg</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Season your beef tenderloin to your taste</li>
    <li>Place your choice of oil/butter on medium heat in a pan large enough to later place your beef tenderloin</li>
    <li>Once heated, place your tenderloin in the pan. searing on each side before removing to a plate and letting it rest. Note that we are not fully cooking the meat, rather, just getting some color before continuing</li>
    <li>Using a food processor, finely chop the mushrooms. Once completed, place the mushrooms and wine in the same pan used for the beef (make sure to deglaze the bottom of the pan for extra flavor) and cook down until a dry. paste-like duxelle remains </li>
    <li>Lay out your prosciutto with slight overlaps on a large sheet of plastic wrap before slathering an even layer the duxelle mixture on top</li>
    <li>Lightly brush the tenderloin with the mustard you have chosen, then place it on the bottom end of the prosciutto sheet</li>
    <li>Carefully roll the beef with the prosciutto by using the plastic wrap to keep everything centered. Once completed, fold the ends of the prosciutto cover so that no piece of the tenderloin is visible</li>
    <li>Fold the plastic wrap over the entire creation, grab the ends of the plastic wrap and roll until it is tightly contained, folding the ends once again and placing it in the refrigerator to rest for at least an hour</li>
    <li>While waiting,roll out your puff pastry on a lightly flowered surface until it is a relatively uniform rectangle that will be able to wrap around the entire tenderloin. Then, place the pastry on another sheet of plastic wrap</li>
    <li>After an hour, remove the tenderloin from the both the fridge and its plastic wrapping before placing it on the end of the puff pastry. Once again, roll the tenderloin so that the pastry covers every inch of it (using the plastic wrap as a guide), trimming any excess pastry before folding the ends. Tightly wrap the tenderloin with the plastic wrap and place in the fridge for a final hour of resting. It's at this point you should preheat your oven to 400 degrees</li>
    <li>Remove the meat from the fridge and lightly brush any visible pastry in egg wash (egg and water beaten together) before scoring the pastry any way you desire (this is for venting the pastry so that it does not become soggy/explode in the oven but can be done in any decorative manner you choose)</li>
    <li>On a foil lined baking sheet, bake the tenderloin for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and let rest for a minimum of ten minutes before serving</li>
