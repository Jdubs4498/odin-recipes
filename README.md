# odin-recipes
This project, the beginnings of a website dedicated to recipes, is meant as a way to display the skills I have gathered thus far in the Odin Project curriculum.
Using what will eventually include HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am to code and build a website from scratch that follows general guidelines. 
Paragraphs, images, lists and other elements will make up the site (initially just showing off HTML abilities), though it won't be made "pretty" until I get a grasp of CSS.
